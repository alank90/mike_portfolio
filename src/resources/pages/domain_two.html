		<h1><b>Domain II: The Classroom Environment</b></h1>
		<br>
		<blockquote>
			<p align="justify">Creating a positive environment in the classroom is an essential component
				of my work. If the atmosphere in the classroom is negative, neither the students nor myself can
				focus on learning and developing. Even though I teach in three different spaces and do not have
				my own dedicated room, I still attempt to create a similar environment in the rooms in which
				I am teaching. Whether I am teaching a mathematics or engineering class, I put a lot of effort into
				creating a culture of learning, respect and collaboration, as well as an environment in which
				expectations and routines are clear. I have found success in my teaching by emphasizing these two twin
				aspects.

	<h3>Creating a Culture of Learning and Collaboration</h3>
	<ul>
		<strong>Student-Centered Learning (Math 454 and Math 433)</strong>
		<blockquote>
			<p>In addition to traditional teaching and lecturing, I like to emphasize student-centered learning and
				teaching in my
				classroom. When students can explain concepts and ideas to each other, they demonstrate that they have
				internalized the ideas well. When appropriate, I like to have students come and do problems and
				exercises
				on the board and explain it to each other.

				</div>
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		<h4><strong>Group Work and Collaboration (Introductory Engineering)</strong></h4>
		<blockquote>
			<p>I encourage students to work in groups when they solve problems. This allows them to listen well
				and collaborate with each other. This is an important skill they will need when they work in a job
				and the classroom is a good setting to begin developing those habits.

		<strong>Office Hours</strong>
		<blockquote>
			<p>I use my office hours to meet with students not just individually but also in groups. This
				allows me to have a discussion with them about mathematics and problem solving. It also gives me
				the opportunity to have students explain work to each other, collaborate and internalize the ideas
				more deeply without me dictating to them. I have found office hours to be a crucial component of my
				teaching in terms of developing a culture of learning and exploration.

	<h3>Managing the Classroom through Routines and Expectations</h3>
	<ul>
		<strong>Syllabus and Course Expectations</strong>
		<blockquote>
			<p>I attempt to set up routines in my classroom to facilitate learning and development. The Syllabus
				which I give out on the first day of class helps to define expectations for the class for both the
				students and myself. Below are some examples from my Mathematics and Engineering courses.
				<br>
				<li>
					<a class="anchor-listener" href="" data-item-link="one">
						Syllabus for Math 433
						<!-- ======= The Modal ================= -->
						<div id="one" class="modal">
							<!-- Modal content -->
							<div class="modal-content">
								<span id="span-one" data-item-span="span-one" class="close">&times;</span>
								<object width="90%" height="600" data="../files/domain_two/433_syllabus.pdf"
									type="application/pdf">
								</object>
							</div>
						</div>
						<!-- ======== End Modal Markup ========== -->
					</a>

				</li>
				<li>
					<a class="anchor-listener" href="" data-item-link="two">
						Syllabus for Physical Computing
						<!-- ======= The Modal ================= -->
						<div id="two" class="modal">
							<!-- Modal content -->
							<div class="modal-content">
								<span id="span-two" data-item-span="span-two" class="close">&times;</span>
								<object width="90%" height="600" data="../files/domain_two/912_syllabus.pdf"
									type="application/pdf">
								</object>
							</div>
						</div>
						<!-- ======== End Modal Markup ========== -->
					</a>

				</li>

		<br>
		<strong>Class Webpage</strong>
		<blockquote>
			<p>I maintain a presence on the Scarsdale Website through my Teacher page. Students can find annoucements,
				class handouts and homework assignments organized by date. They can also find times during which
				I am holding office hours. My Teacher Page allows me to keep the class organized and also gives
				students a place to access materials they need for the class.
